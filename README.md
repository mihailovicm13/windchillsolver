Wind Chill Calculus Problem Solver

In my calculus III class, I was given a problem relating to partial derivatives and using them to solve for the change in Wind Chill knowing a few variables
(temperature, wind speed, and the change in temperature OR wind speed). I decided to solve this problem using Python for fun. This simple code accepts these
variables and outputs the expected change in wind chill.
